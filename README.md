##Admission system

This is a markup for future web-app - **admissions application tracking system for Universities**.


From [Wikipedia][3]: **an applicant tracking system (ATS)** is a software application that enables the electronic handling of recruitment needs.  An ATS is very similar to customer relationship management systems, but are designed for recruitment tracking purposes. Read more on . 
 
###Make repository work
 
To make your fork works fine you need to add`bower_components` to root folder. For this use next command:
```
bower install
```
You can check all dependencies in the file `bower.json` or using command `bower list`

Don't forget install node_modules using this command: 
```
npm install
```

###Possible improvements

Next improvement can be made to this repository:
+ colorize layouts (I like smth like [this][1] )
+ make forms look better (good examples [here][2]  - check  the last answer)
+ animate column with filter  (show\hide by click) 
+ add drop-down menu.

first mockups version is here:: [main page][4], [drop-down menu][5], [add new proposal page][6]
